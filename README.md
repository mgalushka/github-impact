# Idea
As part of my journey in learning C++ language I decided to contribute to some open-source projects which does not
require a lot of deep knowledge of C++ and which I can effectively help in a very short period of time.

So I created this primitive python wrapper around github API to search for smaller sized projects to filter out projects for some topics and programming languages.

# Authentication
To call Github API you will need token - generate API token here:
- https://github.com/settings/tokens

# Usage
```
python impact_search.py github_user_id token
```
