# Idea
One day I was decided to learn c++ language.
I wanted to participate in some open-source projects which does not
require a lot of deep knowledge of c++ and which I can effectively
help in a very short period of time

SO I created this primitive wrapper around github API to search for
smaller sized project on interesting potics/languages.

# Authentication
To call Github API you will need token - generate API token here:
- https://github.com/settings/tokens

# Usage
```
python impact_search.py github_user_id token
```
